# Steganography-Project
Project Title : Hiding Message In An Image

A project involving hiding messages in images utilizes steganography techniques to embed confidential information within image files. This often involves encryption for added security, tools for embedding and extracting messages, and considerations for maintaining image quality and avoiding detection. The project may have applications in secure communication, watermarking, or digital forensics, and it's likely to address ethical and legal considerations associated with the use of steganography.

The ultimate aim is to create a secure and covert communication method with potential applications in fields where discreet information transfer is essential, all while adhering to ethical and legal standards.
