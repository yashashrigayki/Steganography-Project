# Steganography-Project
Project Title : Hiding Message In An Image

A project involving hiding messages in images utilizes steganography techniques to embed confidential information within image files. This often involves encryption for added security, tools for embedding and extracting messages, and considerations for maintaining image quality and avoiding detection. The project may have applications in secure communication, watermarking, or digital forensics, and it's likely to address ethical and legal considerations associated with the use of steganography.

The project incorporates image processing libraries like OpenCV or Pillow for smooth manipulation of pixel data. Security is a focal point, with cryptographic measures implemented, and steganalysis tools like Stegdetect are employed to enhance the resilience of concealed messages to detection. Accessibility and collaborative development are facilitated through the integration of documentation tools and version control systems. In essence, the project navigates the evolving landscape of steganography, providing a flexible solution that balances security, user-friendliness, and ethical considerations
